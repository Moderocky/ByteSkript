# Conditional Effects

The conditional branch headers are all technically 'effects' though they have no actual function other than to mark the start of their [sections](../sections/conditional-if-else.md).

### If

```clike
if %Boolean%
if 1 is 1
if true
if {var} is true
```

See [here](../sections/conditional-if-else.md#if-block) for more details about using this.

### Else-If

```clike
else if %Boolean%
else if 1 is 1
else if true
else if {var} is true
```

See [here](../sections/conditional-if-else.md#else-if-block) for more details about using this.

### Else

```clike
else
```

See [here](../sections/conditional-if-else.md#else-block) for more details about using this.
